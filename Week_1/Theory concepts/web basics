Accessibility (a11y) ensures websites are usable by 
everyone, including people with disabilities.

Principles (POUR):

* Perceivable – content is visible/audible

* Operable – all functionality via keyboard

* Understandable – clear navigation, text

* Robust – works across assistive tech

Best practices:

* Use semantic HTML (<header>, <nav>, <main>)

* Add alt text for images: <img src="img.jpg"   alt="Description">

* Use labels for form inputs

* Maintain color contrast

* Enable keyboard navigation (e.g., using tabindex)
